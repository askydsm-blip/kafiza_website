    "body": "Kafiza was born from a personal journey — from the coffee-growing soul of Brazil to the specialty roaster scene of New Zealand.\n\nFounded by a Brazilian-born, New Zealand-based tech professional, Kafiza blends deep cultural knowledge with technical skills to solve a global challenge. In Brazil, coffee is more than a crop — it’s a way of life. In New Zealand, roasters are hungry for quality and transparency, yet often lack access to authentic, traceable Brazilian beans.\n\nAt the same time, most farmers in Brazil face barriers to reaching international buyers — language, technology, and a lack of visibility in the specialty market.\n\nKafiza’s mission is twofold:\n\nGlobalize the reach of Brazilian coffee culture, beyond the commodity market.\n\nEmpower farmers and educate roasters through transparent data, direct relationships, and cultural storytelling.\n\nMore than a marketplace, Kafiza is a bridge of trust — where coffee connects people, cultures, and purpose."
